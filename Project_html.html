      <p>
        Turkish yogurt is yogurt that comes from Turkey or yogurt that is made
        in the Turkish style. This type of yogurt is one of the most commonly
        eaten throughout the world and is similar in style to Balkan, or
        set-style, yogurt. The word yogurt appears in many different languages
        around the world and was borrowed from the Turkish language where it
        first appeared over one thousand years ago. Though Turkey is one of many
        countries that has a long history of making yogurt, it is believed that
        this food first originated there as well.
